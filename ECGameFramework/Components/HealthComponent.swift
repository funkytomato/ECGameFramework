Abstract:
A `GKComponent` that tracks the "charge" (or "health") of a `PlayerBot` or `TaskBot`. For a `PlayerBot`, "charge" indicates how much power the `PlayerBot` has left before it must recharge (during which time the `PlayerBot` is inactive). For a `TaskBot`, "charge" indicates whether the `TaskBot` is "good" or "bad".
